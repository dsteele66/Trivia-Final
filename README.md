## Project 1 Duncan Steele 


# Trivia 
My game is called Trivia. It’s a game for players who want to test their knowledge of my favorite categories. At this time only one player can play per round but there’s more than enough trivia so it never gets old. No need to keep score. That will all be done for you. You need to get at least half of the questions right in order to win.
